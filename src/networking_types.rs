    /// connection types.)
    ///
    /// If connections are initiated by both peers simultaneously, race conditions
    /// can arise, but fortunately, most of them are handled internally and do not
    /// require any special awareness from the application.  However, there
    /// is one important case that application code must be aware of:
    /// If application code attempts an outbound connection using a ConnectXxx
    /// function in symmetric mode, and a matching incoming connection is already
    /// waiting on a listen socket, then instead of forming a new connection,
    /// the ConnectXxx call will accept the existing incoming connection, and return
    /// a connection handle to this accepted connection.
    /// IMPORTANT: in this case, a SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t
    /// has probably *already* been posted to the queue for the incoming connection!
    /// (Once callbacks are posted to the queue, they are not modified.)  It doesn't
    /// matter if the callback has not been consumed by the app.  Thus, application
    /// code that makes use of symmetric connections must be aware that, when processing a
    /// SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t for an incoming connection, the
    /// m_hConn may refer to a new connection that the app has has not
    /// seen before (the usual case), but it may also refer to a connection that
    /// has already been accepted implicitly through a call to Connect()!  In this
    /// case, AcceptConnection() will return k_EResultDuplicateRequest.
    ///
    /// Only one symmetric connection to a given peer (on a given virtual port)
    /// may exist at any given time.  If client code attempts to create a connection,
    /// and a (live) connection already exists on the local host, then either the
    /// existing connection will be accepted as described above, or the attempt
    /// to create a new connection will fail.  Furthermore, linger mode functionality
    /// is not supported on symmetric connections.
    ///
    /// A more complicated race condition can arise if both peers initiate a connection
    /// at roughly the same time.  In this situation, each peer will receive an incoming
    /// connection from the other peer, when the application code has already initiated
    /// an outgoing connection to that peer.  The peers must resolve this conflict and
    /// decide who is going to act as the "server" and who will act as the "client".
    /// Typically the application does not need to be aware of this case as it is handled
    /// internally.  On both sides, the will observe their outbound connection being
    /// "accepted", although one of them one have been converted internally to act
    /// as the "server".
    ///
    /// In general, symmetric mode should be all-or-nothing: do not mix symmetric
    /// connections with a non-symmetric connection that it might possible "match"
    /// with.  If you use symmetric mode on any connections, then both peers should
    /// use it on all connections, and the corresponding listen socket, if any.  The
    /// behaviour when symmetric and ordinary connections are mixed is not defined by
    /// this API, and you should not rely on it.  (This advice only applies when connections
    /// might possibly "match".  For example, it's OK to use all symmetric mode
    /// connections on one virtual port, and all ordinary, non-symmetric connections
    /// on a different virtual port, as there is no potential for ambiguity.)

    /// When using the feature, you should set it in the following situations on
    /// applicable objects:
    ///
    /// - When creating an outbound connection using ConnectXxx function
    /// - When creating a listen socket.  (Note that this will automatically cause
    ///   any accepted connections to inherit the flag.)
    /// - When using custom signaling, before accepting an incoming connection.
    ///
    /// Setting the flag on listen socket and accepted connections will enable the
    /// API to automatically deal with duplicate incoming connections, even if the
    /// local host has not made any outbound requests.  (In general, such duplicate
    /// requests from a peer are ignored internally and will not be visible to the
