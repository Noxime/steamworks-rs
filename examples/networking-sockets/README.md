# NetworkingSockets Example

This example demonstrates how to use the NetworkingSockets API to send and receive messages over the network.

* Start the application, use the "S" key on one of your computers to start a server
* On the other computer, use the number keys to connect to the server in the list.
* Once you are connected, the server should be able to see the mouse positions of all clients in real time.

## Note
To use this example, you need to have two instances on two machines with two steam accounts running at the same time.
